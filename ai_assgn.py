This code is based on particle filter research includning, particularly, these two articles:
    * Fox, D., Burgard, W., Dellaert, F., & Thrun, S. (1999). Monte carlo localization: Efficient position 
      estimation for mobile robots. AAAI/IAAI, 1999(343-349), 2-2.
    * F. Dellaert, D. Fox, W. Burgard and S. Thrun, "Monte Carlo localization for mobile robots," 
      Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat. No.99CH36288C), 
      1999, pp. 1322-1328 vol.2, doi: 10.1109/ROBOT.1999.772544.
    
Robots and particles derived from the robot class have these features:
    * Constant noise in movement distance and heading expressed as a percentage 
      of the nominal movement distance and direction, respectively
    * Constant noise in sensing distance to the navigation features as a constant 
      percentage of the domain dimension
    * A copy method to permit avoidance of alaising
    * In-place movement: robot x and y coordinates are updated in place rather than needing to 
      instantiate a new robot
    
Distance to navigation features is computed as the Euclidean distance.

Resampling weights for particles are computed via rank of sum of squared differences in distances to navigation
  features robot versus particles
